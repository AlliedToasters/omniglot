# Building Classifiers from Just One Example per Class

This is an experimental project building character classifiers using just one example per class.

The data comes from the [omniglot dataset](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot).

Packages used:

[Capsnet implementation for Keras](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras) by XifengGuo, big thanks to him for putting this together!
[Augmentor](http://augmentor.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for image augmentation.
Scikit image, Keras w/ tensorflow, pandas, numpy, jupyter notebooks.
Gcloud compute for GPU access (thanks for the free credits, Google!)
